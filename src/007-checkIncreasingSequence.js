/**
 * Determines if it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.
 *
 * A sequence is considered strictly increasing if each element is less than the next element in the sequence.
 * A sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.
 *
 * @example
 * // returns false
 * solution([1, 3, 2, 1]);
 * // There is no one element in this array that can be removed to get a strictly increasing sequence.
 *
 * @example
 * // returns true
 * solution([1, 3, 2]);
 * // You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2].
 * // Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
 *
 * @param {number[]} sequence - An array of integers. The array must have at least 2 elements and can have up to 100,000 elements.
 * Each element can range from -100,000 to 100,000.
 * @return {boolean} - Returns true if it is possible to remove one element from the array to achieve a strictly increasing sequence, otherwise returns false.
 *
 * @constraints
 * - Execution time limit: 4 seconds.
 * - Memory limit: 1GB.
